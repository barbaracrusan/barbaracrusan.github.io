Below, you will find excerpts of my most recent posts and links to them. I usually blog about physics, academia, policy, or maybe just something that is keeping me awake at night (which might or might not turn into a cohesive piece of text). My posts reflect my own opinions only and not necessarily those of organizations that I'm a part of.

      <!-- <a class="btn btn-outline-secondary my-2 mx-2" role="button"
         href="{{ post.url }}">READ MORE</a> -->
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
