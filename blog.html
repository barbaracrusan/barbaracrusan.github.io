Below, you will find excerpts of my most recent posts and links to them. I usually blog about physics, academia, policy, or maybe just something that is keeping me awake at night (which might or might not turn into a cohesive piece of text). My posts reflect my own opinions only and not necessarily those of organizations that I'm a part of.
