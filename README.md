# GitHub Repository for barbaracrusan.github.io

This GitHub repository contains the files needed for my personal website (https://barbaracrusan.github.io). A lot of it was inspired by Lauren Chambers' incredible website: https://laurenmarietta.github.io/.

### Resources needed to create files similar to the ones in this repository:
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - free website hosting through GitHub
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - static site generator; very useful for reducing redundancy in source code
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - "an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS."
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - "vector icons and social logos... the web's most popular icon set and toolkit."

### An useful tutorial if you never used Github to build a website:
- [AstroSites](https://astrosites.github.io/) - a quick tutorial to "help you build and publish your professional website" using HTML5 UP and GitHub
